tweet = 'Woohoo! :-)'

if len(tweet) > 140:
    print('Tweet is too long!')

length_of_tweet = len(tweet + 5)

In the last line of this code:
`length_of_tweet = len(tweet + 5)`

Python is attempting to concatenate the value of `tweet` to the integer `5`. Since they are different class types, this operation cannot be done and Python raises an error.
If this line was to be refactored; 
`length_of_tweet = len(tweet) + 5` 
Since len() returns an integer value, the `+` (addition) operation can be evaluated by python between `len(tweet)` and `5`
