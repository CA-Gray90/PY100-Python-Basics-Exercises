# The python documentation on Built-in Exceptions details many errors that we may encounter.
# Syntax errors are raised on the initial parse of the code (first read before running). Python will raise this error when it cannot read the code because
# of a grammatic error, or encounters code that does not conform to the expected structure. The error message often contains helpful hints about where and what 
# the error is.
